/**
 * Backfill `Member.stripeSetupPaymentMethodId` (and `stripeSetupCustomerId`) for
 * members who saved a card but whose payment method was never captured — because
 * the connected-account `checkout.session.completed` webhook wasn't being
 * delivered/verified. Those members were billed MANUAL (offline) at approval
 * instead of on a real Stripe subscription.
 *
 * CUSTOMER-DRIVEN: it scans every customer on the club's connected account,
 * finds the ones that actually have a saved card, and matches each back to a
 * member ONLY via exact customer metadata (`migrationMemberId` from activation
 * or `memberId` from the portal add-card flow). This catches cards saved on
 * customers we never recorded locally (activation retries, legacy
 * `stripeCustomerId`, family-reuse) — not just members whose
 * `stripeSetupCustomerId` is already stored.
 *
 * NO EMAIL FALLBACK (deliberate): matching by email is unsafe — a shared
 * guardian email maps to multiple siblings, and owner/test customers can share
 * an email with a real member row. A card is repaired only when the Stripe
 * customer carries an exact member id in its metadata; everything else is left
 * for manual review.
 *
 * SAFE: reads Stripe and writes ONLY the two member card fields. It never
 * creates/modifies/cancels a subscription and never mutates the Stripe customer.
 * Ambiguous cases (multiple cards with no default; multiple customers for one
 * member; no member match) are SKIPPED and reported — we never guess.
 *
 * Usage (from web/):
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-setup-payment-methods.ts            # dry run
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-setup-payment-methods.ts --apply
 *   npx tsx scripts/backfill-setup-payment-methods.ts --club <clubId> --apply
